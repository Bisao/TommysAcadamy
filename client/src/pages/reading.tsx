const sampleLessonText = `How Will We Eat in 2021?

The pandemic has changed many aspects of our daily lives, including how we eat and where we get our food. Restaurants have adapted to new safety protocols, while home cooking has become more popular than ever.

Many people have discovered the joy of cooking at home. They have learned to prepare meals that were once only available in restaurants. Online grocery shopping has also become a necessity for many families.

Food delivery services have seen unprecedented growth during this time. These companies have hired thousands of new drivers to meet the increased demand. Many restaurants now offer takeout and delivery options that they never had before.

Looking ahead to 2021, experts predict that these changes will continue to shape how we eat. Home cooking will likely remain popular, and restaurants will continue to innovate with new service models. The way we think about food and dining may never be the same.`;
